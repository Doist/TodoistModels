# TodoistModels

TodoistModels is a Java project which provides the base models for most [Todoist API](https://todoist.com/API/) objects.

The naming follows the same as the API, both for classes, variables and methods, with very few helper methods added.

## Usage

For the most part, you should extend the `Base*` class files and add the necessary logic for your application â€” persistence, serialization, syncing, etc, whatever you need.

### General considerations

#### Temporary ids

Temporary ids are negative `long` values. Regular ids start at 0 and go up from there. The API supports any type of value for temporary ids, so special `String` values would also work. However, this would require an additional field to hold the temporary id, additional logic, and seems completely unecessary for most usages.

The generation of temporary ids is up to the host application, but the algorithm can be really simple: start at -1 and go down from there. An Android application could use something like the following:

```
public static synchronized long getNextTempId(Context context) {
	SharedPreferences preferences = context.getSharedPreferences("todoist_temp_ids", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
	SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
	long id = preferences.getLong("temp_id", 0) - 1;
	if (id > Long.MIN_VALUE) {
		editor.putLong("temp_id", id) // Save decremented temp id.
	} else {
		editor.remove("temp_id"); // Restart from -1 in next call.
	}
	editor.commit();
	return id;
}

```
